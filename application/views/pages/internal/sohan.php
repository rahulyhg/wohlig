<h3>Sohan Honakeri
<span class="desig">Web Developer | Web Designer | App Developer</span>
</h3>
<p>He is the quietest guy in the group. He literally won’t open his mouth until absolutely necessary and when it is required. Since he is the quietest, he is teased often and is usually the butt of jokes in the group. But though people make fun of his quiet demeanor, the entire team knows that his patience levels and work skills are unparallel. </p><p>He works like a pro and gives his best in whatever he does. He has had an extraordinary school life where he was yelled for not talking. Yes, for not talking, Sohan was punished. But he sheepishly grins and says that the punishment usually came when he dint answer the questions asked by the teachers. Like he was a good boy in school, he was quiet in college too, but he claims that the friends he had were fun enough to make sure that no matter how quiet he is he does all types of crazy college shit which most people do.  </p><p>He is a complete family person and a very protective brother to both his siblings. Though he is not the most talkative of the three, he surely knows how to pull their legs and have a good laugh with them.</p>
